A structured breakdown of the PC boot process:

1. **Power On:**
   - The user turns on the PC.

2. **CPU Initialization:**
   - The CPU initializes itself and looks for a firmware program stored in the BIOS chip.
   - The BIOS chip is a ROM chip on the motherboard that allows access and setup of the computer system at a basic level.
   - In modern PCs, the CPU loads UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) instead of traditional BIOS.

3. **BIOS/UEFI Execution:**
   - The CPU runs the BIOS/UEFI, which tests and initializes system hardware.
   - The BIOS/UEFI loads configuration settings.
   - If an issue is detected (e.g., missing RAM), an error is thrown, and the boot process stops.
   - This hardware check process is known as POST (Power-On Self-Test).

4. **Handoff to Bootloader:**
   - The BIOS/UEFI hands off responsibility for booting the PC to the OSâ€™s bootloader.
   - The BIOS examines the MBR (Master Boot Record) at the beginning of the disk, which contains code to load the OS (the bootloader).
   - UEFI looks for a small program in the MBR or an EFI system partition and runs it.

5. **Bootloader Execution:**
   - The bootloader is a small program responsible for loading the rest of the operating system.
   - It boots the kernel and then the user space.
   - Different operating systems use different bootloaders:
     - **Windows** uses Windows Boot Manager (`Bootmgr.exe`).
     - **Linux** systems typically use GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader).
     - **Macs** use `boot.efi`.

6. **Operating System Boot:**
   - The bootloader loads the kernel of the operating system.
   - The kernel initializes the user space and other necessary processes, completing the boot process and making the system ready for use.

In summary, the boot process involves the CPU initializing and running BIOS/UEFI, performing a hardware check (POST), handing off to a bootloader, and finally loading the operating system kernel and user space.
