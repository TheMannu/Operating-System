# Different Types of Memory in a Computer System

## 1. Register
- **Description**: Smallest unit of storage. It is a part of the CPU itself.
- **Function**: A register may hold an instruction, a storage address, or any data (such as a bit sequence or individual characters).
- **Usage**: Registers are used to quickly accept, store, and transfer data and instructions that are being used immediately by the CPU.

## 2. Cache
- **Description**: Additional memory system that temporarily stores frequently used instructions and data for quicker processing by the CPU.

## 3. Main Memory
- **Description**: RAM (Random Access Memory).

## 4. Secondary Memory
- **Description**: Storage media on which the computer can store data and programs.

## Comparison

### 1. Cost
- **Primary Storage**: Costly.
- **Registers**: Most expensive due to expensive semiconductors and labor.
- **Secondary Storage**: Cheaper than primary storage.

### 2. Access Speed
- **Primary Storage**: Higher access speed than secondary memory.
- **Registers**: Highest access speed.
- **Cache**: Faster than main memory.
- **Main Memory**: Slower than cache and registers, but faster than secondary memory.

### 3. Storage Size
- **Secondary Memory**: More space compared to primary memory.

### 4. Volatility
- **Primary Memory**: Volatile.
- **Secondary Memory**: Non-volatile.
