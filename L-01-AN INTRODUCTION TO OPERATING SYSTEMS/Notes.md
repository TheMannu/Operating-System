# UNIT 1: AN INTRODUCTION TO OPERATING SYSTEMS

- Application software performs specific tasks for the user.
- System software operates and controls the computer system and provides a platform to run application software.
- An operating system is a piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer system, both hardware and software, and provides an environment in which the user can execute his/her programs in a convenient and efficient manner by hiding underlying complexity of the hardware and acting as a resource manager.

## Why OS?

1. **What if there is no OS?**
   - Bulky and complex app. (Hardware interaction code must be in appâ€™s code base)
   - Resource exploitation by 1 App.
   - No memory protection.

2. **What is an OS made up of?**
   - Collection of system software.

## Operating System Functionality

- Access to the computer hardware.
- Interface between the user and the computer hardware.
- Resource management (memory, device, file, security, process, etc.)
- Hides the underlying complexity of the hardware (Abstraction).
- Facilitates execution of application programs by providing isolation and protection.

**Layers of Interaction:**

- User
- Application programs
- Operating system
- Computer hardware

The operating system provides the means for proper use of the resources in the operation of the computer system.
