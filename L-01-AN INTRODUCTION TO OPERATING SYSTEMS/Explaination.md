### UNIT 1: AN INTRODUCTION TO OPERATING SYSTEMS

**Application Software and System Software**

- **Application Software:** Performs specific tasks for the user, such as word processing, web browsing, or playing games.
- **System Software:** Operates and controls the computer system, providing a platform for application software to run.

**Operating System (OS)**

- **Definition:** An operating system is a piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer system, both hardware and software. It provides an environment for users to execute programs conveniently and efficiently by hiding the underlying complexity of the hardware and acting as a resource manager.

**Why is an OS Necessary?**

1. **Absence of an OS:**
   - **Bulky and Complex Applications:** Without an OS, hardware interaction code must be included in the application's code base, making apps bulky and complex.
   - **Resource Exploitation:** One application could monopolize system resources without an OS to manage and arbitrate resource allocation.
   - **Lack of Memory Protection:** Without an OS, there would be no mechanism to protect memory, leading to potential conflicts and security issues.

2. **Composition of an OS:**
   - An OS is a collection of system software that provides essential functions and services.

**Functions of an Operating System:**

- **Access to Computer Hardware:** Manages direct interaction with hardware components.
- **User-Hardware Interface:** Acts as an intermediary between users and computer hardware.
- **Resource Management (Arbitration):** Manages resources such as memory, devices, files, security, and processes to ensure efficient and fair allocation.
- **Abstraction:** Hides the underlying complexity of hardware, presenting a simpler interface for application programs.
- **Execution Facilitation:** Provides isolation and protection for application programs, ensuring they run correctly and securely.

**OS Structure:**

- **User:** The end-user who interacts with the computer system.
- **Application Programs:** Software applications that perform specific tasks for the user.
- **Operating System:** The system software that manages hardware resources and provides essential services.
- **Computer Hardware:** The physical components of the computer system.

**Role of the Operating System:**

- The OS provides the means for the proper use of resources in the operation of the computer system, ensuring efficient and secure execution of programs. It serves as the backbone of the system, managing hardware and software resources and facilitating user interactions.
